# Textarea Character Counter (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This project demonstrates a **textarea with a dynamic character counter** using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
The character count updates in real time as the user types, and the textarea prevents further input when the maximum limit is reached.

##  Features
- Real-time character counter
- Maximum character limit using `maxlength`
- Border turns red when limit is reached
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation
- No libraries or frameworks

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding `value.length` to count characters
- Using `textContent` to update text in the DOM
- Handling input events in JavaScript
- Basic UI feedback using CSS classes

## How It Works
1. User types inside textarea
2. JavaScript reads the input using `value`
3. Character count is calculated using `.length`
4. Counter display updates using `textContent`
5. When limit is reached, textarea border turns red

## How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Start typing inside the textarea
3. Watch the character counter update in real time
